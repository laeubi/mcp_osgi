# MCP Server Accessibility Test Report

## Objective
Test whether the OSGi MCP server configured in repository settings is accessible from the GitHub Copilot Coding Agent environment.

## Expected OSGi MCP Tools

Based on the code in `OsgiMcpServer.java`, the following tools should be available:

1. **hello_osgi**
   - Description: A demonstration tool that returns a greeting with OSGi context information
   - Input: `name` (string)
   - Output: Text content with OSGi context info

2. **bundle_info**
   - Description: Analyzes a JAR or MANIFEST.MF file for OSGi bundle metadata
   - Input: `file` (path to JAR or MANIFEST.MF)
   - Output: Bundle symbolic name, version, dependencies, packages, capabilities

3. **find**
   - Description: Searches for OSGi packages, bundles, or capabilities
   - Input: `type` (package/bundle/capability), `name` (search term)
   - Output: Download URLs, bundle names, versions

## Test Results

### Available Tools Check
**Status:** ❌ **Not Accessible**

**Test Method:** Examined available MCP tools in the Copilot environment

**Available Tools:** 
- GitHub MCP Server tools (github-mcp-server-*)
- Playwright Browser tools (playwright-browser-*)
- Bash execution tools
- File system tools
- Code review and security tools

**Missing Tools:**
- `hello_osgi` - Not found
- `bundle_info` - Not found  
- `find` - Not found

### Environment Variables
**MCP Status:**
```
COPILOT_MCP_ENABLED=true
COPILOT_AGENT_MCP_SERVER_TEMP=/home/runner/work/_temp/mcp-server
```

**Interpretation:**
- MCP is enabled in the environment
- A temp directory for MCP servers is configured
- However, the OSGi MCP server tools are not currently accessible

## Possible Reasons

### 1. Server Not Started
The OSGi MCP server may need to be explicitly started in the environment. The current implementation uses stdio transport, which requires:
- The server JAR to be built
- The server process to be running
- Configuration in MCP client settings

### 2. Configuration Not Active
The repository settings might have MCP server configuration that isn't yet active or deployed to the Copilot environment.

### 3. Transport Mismatch
The OSGi MCP server uses stdio transport (stdin/stdout), which is designed for:
- Process-based communication
- Direct subprocess invocation
- Client explicitly starting the server

If the Copilot environment expects HTTP-based MCP servers instead, the stdio-based server wouldn't be automatically accessible.

### 4. Build Artifact Not Available
The server needs to be packaged as a JAR first:
```bash
mvn clean package
```

The JAR location needs to be configured in MCP settings:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "osgi": {
      "command": "java",
      "args": ["-jar", "/path/to/mcp-osgi-server-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Recommendation

To make the OSGi MCP server accessible in the GitHub Copilot environment:

### Option 1: HTTP Transport (Recommended for Remote Access)
Add HTTP support using either:
- **jdk.httpserver** (demonstrated in `JdkHttpServerDemo.java`) - Simple, no dependencies
- **Servlet + Jetty** (using MCP SDK's built-in support) - Production-ready

Benefits:
- Can be accessed remotely over HTTP
- Doesn't require process management
- Can run as a standalone service

### Option 2: Stdio with GitHub Actions
Configure GitHub Actions to:
1. Build the MCP server JAR
2. Deploy it to a known location
3. Configure MCP client settings to launch it

Benefits:
- Uses existing stdio implementation
- No code changes needed
- Works with current MCP SDK integration

### Option 3: GitHub Actions Workflow
Create a reusable workflow that:
1. Builds the MCP OSGi server
2. Uploads it as an artifact
3. Provides instructions for local configuration

This is already partially implemented with `.github/workflows/build-mcp-server.yml` (if it exists) or could be added.

## Test Commands Used

```bash
# Check environment variables
env | grep -i mcp

# Examine available tools (manual inspection)
# - Looked through tool names in available functions
# - Searched for "osgi", "hello", "bundle", "find"

# Verified MCP server code exists
cat src/main/java/io/github/laeubi/mcp/osgi/OsgiMcpServer.java

# Confirmed tools are defined in code
grep -A 5 "createHelloOsgiTool\|createBundleInfoTool\|createFindTool" src/main/java/io/github/laeubi/mcp/osgi/OsgiMcpServer.java
```

## Conclusion

**Status:** The OSGi MCP server tools are **not currently accessible** in the GitHub Copilot Coding Agent environment.

**Verified:**
- ✅ MCP server code exists and compiles
- ✅ Tools are properly defined (hello_osgi, bundle_info, find)
- ✅ MCP is enabled in environment (COPILOT_MCP_ENABLED=true)
- ❌ OSGi MCP tools are not in the available tools list

**Next Steps:**
1. Determine if HTTP transport should be added for remote accessibility
2. Configure MCP server deployment if stdio transport is preferred
3. Add documentation for configuring the server in Copilot environments
