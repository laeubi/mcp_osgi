# Investigation Summary: jdk.httpserver for MCP OSGi Server

**Date:** October 28, 2025  
**Issue:** #19 - Investigate usage of jdk.httpserver  
**Status:** ✅ Complete

## Executive Summary

This investigation examined using Java's built-in `jdk.httpserver` as an alternative to Jetty for the MCP OSGi Server. The key finding is that **the current codebase does not use Jetty**, making the issue premise incorrect. The server uses stdio transport, which is optimal for GitHub Copilot integration.

A working proof-of-concept HTTP server using `jdk.httpserver` was created to demonstrate feasibility. The investigation concludes that:
1. No changes are needed for the current use case
2. jdk.httpserver is viable if HTTP transport is required in the future
3. Current stdio implementation is already optimal

## Investigation Scope

### Tasks Completed ✅
1. ✅ Analyzed current MCP server implementation
2. ✅ Reviewed jdk.httpserver documentation and capabilities
3. ✅ Created working proof-of-concept HTTP server
4. ✅ Tested HTTP server with MCP-style JSON-RPC requests
5. ✅ Compared jdk.httpserver with servlet containers
6. ✅ Verified all existing tests still pass
7. ✅ Tested OSGi MCP server accessibility in Copilot environment
8. ✅ Documented findings and recommendations
9. ✅ Addressed code review feedback
10. ✅ Completed security scan (0 vulnerabilities)

## Key Findings

### 1. Current Implementation

**Transport Layer:**
- Uses `StdioServerTransportProvider` from MCP Java SDK 0.14.1
- Communicates via stdin/stdout (not HTTP)
- **No Jetty dependency** in pom.xml or codebase

**Dependencies:**
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.modelcontextprotocol.sdk</groupId>
    <artifactId>mcp</artifactId>
    <version>0.14.1</version>
</dependency>
```

**Tools Exposed:**
- `hello_osgi` - Demonstration tool with OSGi context info
- `bundle_info` - JAR/MANIFEST.MF analysis for bundle metadata
- `find` - Search for OSGi packages, bundles, capabilities

### 2. JDK HTTP Server Capabilities

**Proof-of-Concept:** `JdkHttpServerDemo.java`

**Features Demonstrated:**
- ✅ JSON-RPC 2.0 request parsing and validation
- ✅ MCP protocol method handling (initialize, tools/list)
- ✅ Health check endpoint
- ✅ CORS headers for web clients
- ✅ Proper error responses
- ✅ No external dependencies

**Test Results:**
```bash
$ curl http://localhost:8090/health
{"status": "ok", "server": "jdk.httpserver"}

$ curl -X POST http://localhost:8090/mcp \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"initialize","params":{}}'
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "result": {
    "protocolVersion": "2024-11-05",
    "serverInfo": {
      "name": "mcp-osgi-http-demo",
      "version": "1.0.0"
    },
    "capabilities": {
      "tools": true
    }
  }
}
```

**Performance Characteristics:**
- Lightweight: ~240 lines of code
- Fast startup: < 1 second
- Low memory: Minimal overhead beyond JVM
- Simple API: Easy to understand and maintain

### 3. OSGi MCP Server Accessibility

**Environment Check:**
- `COPILOT_MCP_ENABLED=true` ✅
- `COPILOT_AGENT_MCP_SERVER_TEMP=/home/runner/work/_temp/mcp-server` ✅
- OSGi MCP tools accessible: ❌

**Analysis:**
The OSGi MCP server tools (hello_osgi, bundle_info, find) are not currently accessible in the GitHub Copilot Coding Agent environment because:
1. Stdio transport requires explicit server process startup
2. Server JAR needs to be built and deployed
3. MCP client configuration must specify server launch command

**To Make Accessible:**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "osgi": {
      "command": "java",
      "args": ["-jar", "/path/to/mcp-osgi-server-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar"],
      "description": "MCP server providing OSGi tools"
    }
  }
}
```

## Comparison: jdk.httpserver vs Jetty

### jdk.httpserver (Demonstrated)

**Advantages:**
- ✅ No external dependencies (part of JDK since Java 6)
- ✅ Simple API (~200 lines for basic server)
- ✅ Lightweight and fast
- ✅ Good for demos, testing, simple use cases
- ✅ Easy to embed and configure

**Limitations:**
- ❌ Not designed for production/high-performance use
- ❌ No servlet API support
- ❌ Limited features (no built-in SSE, WebSockets)
- ❌ Requires manual MCP protocol implementation

### Jetty (Not Currently Used)

**Advantages:**
- ✅ Production-ready and battle-tested
- ✅ Rich feature set (SSE, WebSockets, HTTP/2)
- ✅ MCP SDK provides built-in servlet transports
- ✅ High performance and scalability
- ✅ Extensive documentation and community

**Limitations:**
- ❌ External dependency (~3-10 MB)
- ❌ More complex configuration
- ❌ Heavier than jdk.httpserver
- ❌ Overkill for simple use cases

## Recommendations

### For Current GitHub Copilot Use Case: Keep Stdio ✅

**Rationale:**
- Stdio is optimal for process-based AI integration
- Lightweight and simple
- Works perfectly with current MCP SDK
- No additional complexity or dependencies
- All tests pass (12/12)

**Action:** No changes needed

### If HTTP Transport is Required

#### Scenario 1: Simple HTTP Access (Demos, Testing)
**Recommendation:** Use jdk.httpserver

**Implementation:**
- Use `JdkHttpServerDemo.java` as starting point
- Adapt for actual MCP server integration
- ~300 lines of code total
- Zero new dependencies

**Benefits:**
- Minimal complexity
- No dependency management
- Fast iteration and testing

#### Scenario 2: Production HTTP Service
**Recommendation:** Use Jetty with MCP SDK servlet transports

**Implementation:**
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.eclipse.jetty</groupId>
    <artifactId>jetty-server</artifactId>
    <version>11.0.15</version>
</dependency>
```

Use MCP SDK's built-in transports:
- `HttpServletSseServerTransportProvider` - For SSE
- `HttpServletStreamableServerTransportProvider` - For streaming
- `HttpServletStatelessServerTransport` - For stateless HTTP

**Benefits:**
- Production-ready
- Full MCP SDK integration
- Advanced HTTP features

## Conclusion

### Primary Finding
**The issue premise is incorrect.** The MCP OSGi Server does not use Jetty. It uses stdio transport from the MCP Java SDK, which is optimal for the current use case (GitHub Copilot integration).

### Secondary Finding
**jdk.httpserver is fully viable** for HTTP-based MCP communication. The proof-of-concept demonstrates that it can handle JSON-RPC requests, implement MCP protocol methods, and serve as a lightweight alternative to servlet containers.

### Recommendation
**No action needed** for the current implementation. If HTTP transport becomes a requirement in the future, both jdk.httpserver (for simplicity) and Jetty (for production) are viable options.

### Next Steps

If the repository owner wants to proceed with HTTP support:

1. **Clarify Requirements**
   - Is HTTP transport actually needed?
   - What's the use case (remote access, web UI, API)?
   - Production or demo/testing?

2. **Choose Implementation**
   - Simple: Extend `JdkHttpServerDemo.java`
   - Production: Use MCP SDK servlet support + Jetty

3. **Configure Deployment**
   - Determine how/where server should run
   - Set up MCP client configuration
   - Document usage for end users
