# Environment Setup Investigation Summary

## Problem Statement
The custom MCP OSGi server was failing to start as part of GitHub Copilot Coding Agent sessions. Issues to investigate:
1. Are all tools installed?
2. Can the JAR file be found and started with the configured args?
3. Could the MCP environment be different/isolated from the workspace?
4. Should we test a simple example first?

## Investigation Results

### ✅ All Tools Are Installed
- **Java**: OpenJDK 17.0.16 (Temurin) ✓
- **Maven**: Apache Maven 3.9.11 ✓
- Both are properly configured and functional

### ✅ JAR File Can Be Started
The server JAR can be successfully:
- Built using `mvn clean package -DskipTests -B -V`
- Started in stdio mode: `java -jar /home/runner/tools/osgi_mcp/server.jar`
- Started in server mode: `java -jar /home/runner/tools/osgi_mcp/server.jar server [port]`

### ✅ MCP Environment Is Accessible
- Environment variable `COPILOT_MCP_ENABLED=true` is set
- Environment variable `COPILOT_AGENT_MCP_SERVER_TEMP=/home/runner/work/_temp/mcp-server` is set
- MCP config file exists at `/home/runner/work/_temp/mcp-server/mcp-config.json`
- Current MCP environment has 56 tools loaded (but none from OSGi yet)
- Workspace is at `GITHUB_WORKSPACE=/home/runner/work/mcp_osgi/mcp_osgi` and is accessible

### ⚠️ Issues Found and Fixed

#### 1. Path Inconsistencies
**Problem**: Multiple configuration files had different paths for the JAR:
- `.github/copilot-setup-steps.yml` copies to `/home/runner/tools/osgi_mcp/server.jar`
- `mcp-client-config-copilot-agent.json` referenced `/home/runner/target/mcp-osgi-server-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar`
- Documentation showed various paths

**Fix**: Standardized all paths to `/home/runner/tools/osgi_mcp/server.jar`

#### 2. Missing Transport Mode
**Problem**: The configuration didn't specify the server mode (HTTP/SSE transport)

**Fix**: Added `"server"` argument to the args array in MCP config. GitHub Copilot Coding Agent requires HTTP/SSE transport, not stdio.

#### 3. Wrong Type in MCP Config
**Problem**: Some examples used `"type": "stdio"` which doesn't work for Copilot Coding Agent

**Fix**: Changed to `"type": "local"` for GitHub Copilot integration

## Correct Configuration

### For GitHub Copilot Coding Agent

The `.github/copilot-setup-steps.yml` workflow:
1. Builds the JAR
2. Copies it to `/home/runner/tools/osgi_mcp/server.jar`

The MCP configuration should be:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "osgi": {
      "type": "local",
      "command": "java",
      "args": [
        "-jar",
        "/home/runner/tools/osgi_mcp/server.jar",
        "server"
      ],
      "tools": ["hello_osgi", "bundle_info", "find"],
      "description": "MCP server providing OSGi tools for AI agents"
    }
  }
}
```

**Key points**:
- `type: "local"` is required (not "stdio")
- The `server` argument is **required** to start HTTP/SSE mode
- Path must be absolute: `/home/runner/tools/osgi_mcp/server.jar`

## Verification

Run the verification script to check your environment:

```bash
./verify-environment.sh
```

This script checks:
- ✓ Java and Maven installation
- ✓ JAR file existence in both build and deployment locations
- ✓ Server functionality in stdio mode
- ✓ Server functionality in HTTP/SSE mode
- ✓ MCP environment variables
- ✓ Workspace visibility

## Server Modes

The MCP OSGi server supports two modes:

### stdio Mode (Default)
```bash
java -jar /home/runner/tools/osgi_mcp/server.jar
```
- Communicates via stdin/stdout using JSON-RPC 2.0
- Used for traditional MCP clients and direct process communication
- Good for testing with pipes and shell scripts

### Server Mode (HTTP/SSE)
```bash
java -jar /home/runner/tools/osgi_mcp/server.jar server [port]
```
- Runs HTTP server with Server-Sent Events (SSE) transport
- **Required for GitHub Copilot Coding Agent**
- Default port: 3000
- Endpoint: `http://localhost:[port]/mcp/sse`

## Testing

### Test stdio mode:
```bash
echo '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"initialize","params":{"protocolVersion":"2024-11-05","clientInfo":{"name":"test","version":"1.0"}}}' | \
  java -jar /home/runner/tools/osgi_mcp/server.jar
```

### Test server mode:
```bash
# Start server
java -jar /home/runner/tools/osgi_mcp/server.jar server 3000 &

# Test SSE endpoint
curl -v http://localhost:3000/mcp/sse
```

## Next Steps

1. **Ensure setup steps are executed**: The `.github/copilot-setup-steps.yml` must be run to build and deploy the JAR
2. **Verify configuration**: Use the correct MCP configuration with `type: "local"` and `server` argument
3. **Check registration**: After configuration, the OSGi tools should appear in the MCP environment
4. **Monitor logs**: Server logs are helpful for debugging connection issues

## Files Changed

1. `.github/copilot-setup-steps.yml` - Fixed echo message to show correct path
2. `mcp-client-config-copilot-agent.json` - Updated to use correct path, type, and server argument
3. `README.md` - Updated documentation with correct paths and requirements
4. `.github/workflows/README.md` - Fixed example configuration
5. `verify-environment.sh` (new) - Comprehensive environment verification script
6. `test-mcp-integration.sh` (new) - Integration test for MCP server

## Recommendations

1. **Use absolute paths**: Always use absolute paths for JAR locations in Copilot environment
2. **Use server mode**: GitHub Copilot requires HTTP/SSE transport, not stdio
3. **Test locally first**: Use `verify-environment.sh` before expecting Copilot integration to work
4. **Check MCP config**: The server won't be available until properly registered in MCP config
5. **Monitor first run**: Check that setup steps complete successfully on first Copilot session
